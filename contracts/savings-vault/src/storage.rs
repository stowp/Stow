//! Storage helpers and TTL management.
//!
//! Centralize all `env.storage()` access here so the persistence strategy
//! (instance vs. persistent, TTL bumping) lives in one place.
//!
//! # Storage model
//!
//! Soroban gives contracts three storage durabilities; this crate uses two
//! of them, chosen per [`DataKey`] variant as documented on each variant:
//!
//! - **Instance storage** — attached to the contract instance itself. Used
//!   for small, hot, singleton values that are read on nearly every call:
//!   `Token`, `Admin`, `DepositCap`, `Config`, and the `Next*Id` counters.
//!   Cheapest option for this shape of data, and its TTL is bumped as a
//!   single unit by [`extend_instance_ttl`], called at the top of every
//!   state-changing entrypoint — so as long as the contract sees any
//!   mutating traffic within the bump window, none of these values expire.
//! - **Persistent storage** — one entry per record, for unbounded
//!   collections keyed by user or id: `Flexible(Address)`, `Locked(u64)`,
//!   `Goal(u64)`, `Group(u64)`. These do **not** share a TTL with the
//!   instance; each entry's TTL is refreshed only when that specific entry
//!   is written. A record that is never touched again (e.g. a flexible
//!   account drained to zero and abandoned) will eventually hit its
//!   minimum persistent TTL and become eligible for archival by the
//!   network; reading an archived entry then requires a `restore` before
//!   the next `get`. [`extend_persistent_ttl`] is called after every read
//!   and write of a `Flexible`, `Locked`, `Goal`, or `Group` record so a
//!   record touched within the bump window never expires.
//!
//! ## TTL policy
//!
//! [`INSTANCE_BUMP_AMOUNT`] / [`INSTANCE_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`] control the
//! instance TTL. [`PERSISTENT_BUMP_AMOUNT`] / [`PERSISTENT_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`]
//! control persistent per-entry TTLs via [`extend_persistent_ttl`], called
//! on every read and write of an `Account`/`Plan`/`Goal`/`Group` record.
//!
//! ## Storage cost for large groups
//!
//! `Group` (see [`DataKey::Group`]) stores its full `members` vector and
//! `shares_bps` map inline in a single persistent entry. Every `join`,
//! `contribute`, `set_shares`, or `settle` call reads and rewrites that
//! entire entry, so per-call cost — and the rent required to keep the
//! entry's TTL alive — scales linearly with membership size. There is no
//! enforced cap on group size; a very large group is progressively more
//! expensive to mutate and to keep from expiring than a small one.
