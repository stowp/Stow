# yield-adapter

Optional, opt-in yield-routing adapter for **Stow**, on Stellar/Soroban (Rust, `soroban-sdk` 22).

`savings-vault` custodies principal with no yield logic (by design — see its
README). This crate is the separate, swappable layer referenced in the root
`README.md`'s "Contract Layout" section as `yield_adapter/`: it accepts
deposits (in the same SEP-41 token as `savings-vault`, e.g. USDC), routes
idle balances into a registered external "strategy" contract, and reports
yield back to depositors via a share-based exchange rate — never by touching
`savings-vault`'s own storage.

This crate is a **skeleton**. Every entrypoint is stubbed with
`unimplemented!()` and a `TODO(issue)` comment describing intended behavior
and acceptance criteria. Each stub is designed to become one GitHub issue.
The reference below documents the contract's intended, stable interface so
integrators (indexer, backend, frontend) can build against it without
reading the stub bodies.

## Wasm size budget & optimization

CI builds this crate, runs `stellar contract optimize`, and fails if the
optimized wasm exceeds `WASM_SIZE_BUDGET_BYTES` (see
`.github/workflows/contract-ci.yml`, `yield-adapter` job). Currently set to
the same 64 KiB starting budget as `savings-vault`; revisit once the crate
is implemented and its real size is known.

## Strategy interface

A "strategy" is any external contract registered via `register_strategy`.
This adapter treats it as opaque and reaches it only through
`env.invoke_contract`. At minimum a usable strategy must expose:

- `deposit(from: Address, amount: i128)` — accept `amount` of the shared
  SEP-41 token from the adapter.
- `withdraw(to: Address, amount: i128)` — return `amount` to the adapter.
- `balance(of: Address) -> i128` — report the adapter's current claim,
  **including** any accrued yield (or loss) — this is what `harvest` diffs
  against the adapter's last-known deployed balance to compute yield.

A minimal in-repo mock implementing this interface (for tests) is tracked as
its own issue — see `test.rs`'s module doc.

**Trust boundary**: the adapter does not verify a strategy's solvency or
correctness beyond the `balance` figure it reports. A malicious or buggy
strategy can misreport yield (see `harvest::apply_performance_fee`'s
guard against charging fees on a loss, which limits — but does not
eliminate — the damage a lying strategy can do). Registering a strategy is
an explicit, admin-only trust decision; see `circuit_breaker` for the
emergency exit if that trust turns out to be misplaced.

## Entrypoint reference

See each module's doc comments (`admin.rs`, `strategy.rs`, `deposit.rs`,
`withdraw.rs`, `accounting.rs`, `harvest.rs`, `fees.rs`,
`circuit_breaker.rs`) for the authoritative, per-function contract: auth
requirements, validation order, and errors returned.

## Storage layout

All storage access goes through `src/storage.rs`; the keys are the
`DataKey` variants in `src/types.rs`. Keys fall into two durability
classes, following the same split as `savings-vault`:

- **Instance storage** — small, hot singletons read on nearly every call.
  They share one TTL with the contract instance itself, so the contract
  cannot outlive its config (or vice versa).
- **Persistent storage** — unbounded, per-key records (one entry per
  strategy, position, or withdraw request). Each entry has its own TTL, so
  a rarely-touched record can be archived without affecting the rest.

No key uses temporary storage: every record here must survive until it is
explicitly overwritten.

### TTL policy

TTLs are in ledgers (1 ledger ≈ 5 s, so `DAY_IN_LEDGERS = 17_280`).

| Class | Bumped by | Extend to (`*_BUMP_AMOUNT`) | Only if remaining TTL below (`*_LIFETIME_THRESHOLD`) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Instance | `extend_instance_ttl`, at the top of every state-changing entrypoint | 30 days | 29 days |
| Persistent | `extend_persistent_ttl(key)`, after every read **and** write of that entry | 30 days | 29 days |

The threshold is one day below the bump amount, so each entry is extended
at most about once a day however often it is touched. These values are
copied from `savings-vault` as a starting point and are not yet tuned for
this contract's access pattern (see the `TODO(issue)` in `storage.rs`).

An archived persistent entry (a position left untouched for over 30 days)
is not lost: it has to be restored (`RestoreFootprint`) before it can be
read again. Integrators should expect this for long-dormant positions.

### Keys

| `DataKey` variant | Durability | Value type | Absent means | Written by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Admin` | instance | `Address` | not initialized | `initialize`, `set_admin` |
| `Treasury` | instance | `Address` | not initialized | `initialize`, `set_treasury` |
| `Token` | instance | `Address` (SEP-41, same as `savings-vault`'s) | not initialized | `initialize` |
| `Paused` | instance | `bool` | `false` (unpaused) | `set_paused` |
| `PerformanceFeeBps` | instance | `u32` (0–10_000) | `0` | `set_performance_fee_bps` |
| `HarvestInterval` | instance | `u64` seconds | no minimum | admin config |
| `LastHarvestAt` | instance | `u64` ledger timestamp | never harvested | `harvest` |
| `WithdrawCooldown` | instance | `u64` seconds | `0` | `set_withdraw_cooldown` |
| `ActiveStrategy` | instance | `u64` strategy id | no active strategy (funds held idle) | `set_active_strategy`, `migrate_strategy`, `emergency_withdraw_all` (clears) |
| `NextStrategyId` | instance | `u64` counter | `0` (first id is `1`) | `register_strategy` via `next_id` |
| `NextWithdrawId` | instance | `u64` counter | `0` (first id is `1`) | `request_withdraw` via `next_id` |
| `TotalShares` | instance | `i128` | `0` | `deposit`, `request_withdraw`, `cancel_withdraw` |
| `FeesAccrued` | instance | `i128` stroops | `0` | `harvest` (credit), `withdraw_fees` (reset) |
| `Strategy(u64)` | persistent | `StrategyInfo` | unknown id → `Error` | `register_strategy`, `deregister_strategy`, `set_strategy_deposit_cap` |
| `Position(Address)` | persistent | `Position` | no position | `deposit`, `request_withdraw`, `cancel_withdraw` |
| `WithdrawRequest(u64)` | persistent | `WithdrawRequest` | unknown id → `Error` | `request_withdraw`, `claim_withdraw`, `cancel_withdraw` |

Notes:

- **`TotalShares` is a running total**, not a sum over `Position` entries.
  Soroban cannot iterate persistent keys, so it must be kept in step with
  every share mint/burn in the same call.
- **`Position` stores shares, never an asset amount.** Its USDC value is
  `convert_to_assets(shares)`, which moves every time `harvest` changes the
  exchange rate. Caching an amount would go stale on the next harvest.
- **`WithdrawRequest` and `Strategy` records are never deleted.** A resolved
  request keeps `claimed_at`/`cancelled_at` set, and a deregistered strategy
  keeps `deregistered_at`, so history stays readable on-chain until the
  entry's TTL lapses.
- Total assets are not stored: `total_assets()` is computed on read as the
  adapter's idle token balance plus the active strategy's reported
  `balance` (idle balance only if there is no active strategy, or its
  `balance` call fails).

## Event schema

**Version: `1`** (see [`events::EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`](src/events.rs)). The
[`init`](#init) event's data payload includes `schema_version` so an indexer
can check it was built against a compatible schema before decoding
subsequent events from that contract instance.

### Stability guarantees

- **Topic names are stable identifiers.** Once shipped, a topic name is
  never renamed or reused for a different meaning.
- **Additive changes do not bump the version:** a new topic, or a new
  *trailing* field appended to an existing topic's data tuple, is
  backwards-compatible. Existing decoders keep working and ignore the new
  field.
- **Breaking changes bump `EVENT_SCHEMA_VERSION`** and are called out in
  this section: removing a topic, removing or reordering an existing
  field, changing a field's type, or changing which values appear in the
  topics tuple.
- Field order within an event's data tuple is part of the schema. Decode
  by position, not by name.
- Events within a single contract invocation are emitted in the order
  described below; ordering across invocations follows ledger close order.

### Encoding

Every event is published as `env.events().publish(topics, data)`:

- **Topics** — a tuple whose first element is always a `Symbol` naming the
  event (the constants in `src/events.rs`, e.g. `"harvested"`). Names longer
  than 9 characters use `Symbol::new`, not `symbol_short!`. Where noted, a
  second topic carries the primary subject (`owner: Address`, or a strategy
  `id: u64`) and, for withdraw requests, a third topic carries the request
  `id: u64`, so indexers can filter server-side (`topic1 == owner`) without
  decoding every event's data.
- **Data** — a fixed-order tuple of the fields in each table below.
  `Address`, `String`, `BytesN<32>` and `Option<u64>` decode as their
  standard Soroban XDR `ScVal` representations (`Option::None` is
  `ScVal::Void`).
- **Amounts** (`i128`) are in the vault token's base units (stroops). Share
  counts (`i128`) are in share units. Timestamps (`u64`) are ledger
  timestamps in seconds since the Unix epoch.

Config setters that are not listed below (`set_treasury`,
`set_performance_fee_bps`, `set_withdraw_cooldown`,
`set_strategy_deposit_cap`) emit no event; read their current value from the
matching getter.
